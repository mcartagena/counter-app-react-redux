# Simple React-Redux example

Let's build a counter application using React and Redux.

-- By clicking the “+” button, here the count becomes count + 1.
-- By clicking the “-” button, here the count becomes count – 1.
-- By clicking the “Increment if odd” button, here the count becomes count + 1 if the count is odd.
-- By clicking the “Increment if async” button, here the count becomes count + 1.
